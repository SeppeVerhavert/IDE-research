## Positives:

 * Built-in browser live-updating

>Brackets will **automatically refresh** the browser and load the latest saved version of a file open in the browser. This works with php as well. Editing a css will even highlight the tag that's currently being worked on. 



 * Free, open source and cross-platform and is actively developed

>Brackets is entirely **free** and open source and is being actively maintained and developed.

 * Lightweight

> Brackets is easy on memory usage and it starts up quickly.

 * Can be hacked by any front-end developer

> The editor is built in such a way that it is extendable by any front-end developer.

## Negatives:


 1. Still missing some elementary text editor commands

> Some gaps have to be filled by plugins, while these features should be built in.
>For example:

  - [ ] Jump to matching brace (bracket / parenthesis)
  - [ ] Recall previous searches / replacements
  - [ ] Autofill of search field with text under caret (text has to be selected)
  
 2. Problematic updater

> Though the website says there is an update *available*, the updater in Brackets may give you an error, resulting in you having to download updates manually.

 3. Supports only web languages by default

> Brackets is **built for web development** and that's where it excels at out of the box. Other languages that have a CodeMirror mode can be added as well. language support plugins can be added.
