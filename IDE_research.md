# Research on different IDE's


## 1. Visual Studio Code

|Pros|Cons  |
|--|--|
| Visual Studio Code is possibly the best JavaScript ide for Windows, Mac, and Linux. | Interface is one major difference. |
| It provides great syntax highlighting and auto-complete with IntelliSense based on variable types, function definitions, and imported modules. | Directory structure is insane with the number of files in the directory tree. |
| It allows you to debug code by launching or attaching to your running apps debug with breakpoints, call stacks, and an interactive console. |  |

## 2. Atom by Github

| Pros | Cons |
|--|--|
| Easily and extensively customizable. Customization beyond that afforded by plugins provided by the Atom community must be done via writing plugins or scripts in CoffeeScript or JavaScript. | Slow to start, although with the release of version 1.3.0 the start time has been supposedly cut by 20-30%. |
| Intuitive and easy to learn. |  |
| Support for a wide range of different computer languages. |  |
| Very feature-packed, so feature packed it can be used as both a text editor and an IDE. |  |

## 3. Code::Blocks

| Pros | Cons |
|--|--|
| Has code linting for its three supported languages. | Only supports three programming languages: C, C++ and Fortran. |
| Easy to install on both distributions. | Fairly infrequently updated. New releases come out once every few years.|
| Fairly lightweight.  |  |
| Feature-packed. |  |


## 4. Eclipse

| Pros | Cons |
|--|--|
| Written in Java, so it is incredibly cross-platform. | Most distributions either do not have it in their official repositories or keep fairly old versions in their official repositories. |
| Has a cross-distribution 64-bit AppImage. | Fairly heavy on system resource usage. Slow to boot. |
|  | Extra plugins are required in order to program in other programming languages. |


## 5. LightTable

| Pros | Cons |
|--|--|
| Fairly feature-packed, keeping in mind its being limited, in its intended use, to web development. | Requires fairly out-of-date libraries to run, if installed the old-fashion way using a package manager. |
| Easy to obtain on most Linux distributions thanks to its AppImage. | Has a limited set of intended uses. |




## 6. Brackets

> The free Brackets software is a must try tool for front-end developers.

## Positives:

 * Built-in browser live-updating

>Brackets will **automatically refresh** the browser and load the latest saved version of a file open in the browser. This works with php as well. Editing a css will even highlight the tag that's currently being worked on. 



 * Free, open source and cross-platform and is actively developed

>Brackets is entirely **free** and open source and is being actively maintained and developed.

 * Lightweight

> Brackets is easy on memory usage and it starts up quickly.

 * Can be hacked by any front-end developer

> The editor is built in such a way that it is extendable by any front-end developer.

| languages | Bracket support  |
|--|--|
| HTML | :white_check_mark: |
| CSS | :white_check_mark: |
| Javascript | :white_check_mark: |
| Pyhton | :x: |


## Negatives:


 1. Still missing some elementary text editor commands

> Some gaps have to be filled by plugins, while these features should be built in.
>For example:

  - [ ] Jump to matching brace (bracket / parenthesis)
  - [ ] Recall previous searches / replacements
  - [ ] Autofill of search field with text under caret (text has to be selected)
  
 2. Problematic updater

> Though the website says there is an update *available*, the updater in Brackets may give you an error, resulting in you having to download updates manually.

 3. Supports only web languages by default

> Brackets is **built for web development** and that's where it excels at out of the box. Other languages that have a CodeMirror mode can be added as well. language support plugins can be added.
