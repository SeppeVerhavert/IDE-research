## Positives:

 * Built-in browser live-updating

>Brackets will automatically refresh the browser and load the latest saved version >of a file open in the browser. This works with php as well. Editing a css will >even highlight the tag that's currently being worked on. 

 * Built-in extension manager

>The functionality of Brackets can be extended via a simple-to-use extension >manager. The extension manager also has a considerable number of extensions and >themes.

 * Free, open source and cross-platform

>Brackets is entirely free and open source.

 * Actively developed

> Brackets is being actively maintained and developed.

 * Can style a tag without switching over to the stylesheet

> A feature called "Quick Edit" allows the user to select a tag in (a html file, for example) and edit the associated style without switching over to the css document. It also supports SASS and LESS pre-processors.

 * Lightweight

> Brackets is easy on memory usage and it starts up quickly.

 * Popup previews

> Hovering over colors hex codes or image paths will pop up previews of corresponding colors and images.

 * Drag and drop support

> Brackets supports drag and drop of text, as well as multi / rectangular selection.

 * Can be hacked by any front-end developer

> The editor is built using html, css, and javascript, making it extendable by any front-end developer.

 * Multi-line (multi-query) editing

> You can have your cursor independently on multiple lines and so creating templates and/or editing multiple things at once is really fast and easy.

 * Vim mode

> Vim-style editing is already built in the text editor.

 * Support for Adobe PSD content

> A default extension allows for the extraction of PSD resources, such as images and styles. There's good integration for placing extracted resources into source.


## Negatives:


 * Still missing some elementary text editor commands

> Some gaps have to be filled by plugins, while these features should be built in.
>For example:
>
>    Jump to matching brace (bracket / parenthesis);
>    Gutter selection of lines;
>    Recall previous searches / replacements;
>    Autofill of search field with text under caret (text has to be selected);
>    Show whitespace / end of lines / indentation guides / right margin;
>    Selection to upper / lower case;
>    and some more.

 * Problematic updater

> Though the website says there is an update available, the updater in Brackets may give you an error, resulting in you having to download updates manually.


 * Supports only web languages by default

> Brackets is built for web development and that's where it excels at out of the box. Other languages that have a CodeMirror mode can be added as well. language support plugins can be added.
